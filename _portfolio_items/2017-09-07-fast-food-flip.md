This was the first project in my Game Design class. We had to create a game in Java with the theme of fast food, just to show what we knew coming in to the class. We had around two weeks, starting from the first day, and I created a game with Greenfoot called Fast Food Flip.

To download and play the game, read the instructions at the [project's repository](https://github.com/lizgw/FastFoodFlip).
