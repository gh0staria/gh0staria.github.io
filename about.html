<div class="about">
  <section class="about-text">
    <p>Hi! I'm Liz Wigglesworth. I'm a Computer Science student working towards my B.S at the University of Texas at
      Dallas.</p>
    <p>I write code at <a href="https://broadcastsims.com/" target="_blank">BroadcastSIMS</a>, an educational software
      startup that gives broadcast
      teachers the tools they need to prepare their students for the live production industry.</p>
    <p>My <a href="https://github.com/lizgw" target="_blank">GitHub</a> also has side projects I've worked on over the
      years. They range from small
      example repos to semester-long projects. The ones I'm proudest of are in <a href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Some of my interests in technology are...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cybersecurity in general</li>
      <li>digital forensics</li>
      <li>cryptography</li>
      <li>distributed tech &amp; the p2p web</li>
      <li>computer literacy &amp; technical education</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But of course, I&#39;m not all about technology. Some other things I do are...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning languages! If I wasn&#39;t interested in computer science, I probably would&#39;ve been a linguist.
        The
        way that languages work and how they&#39;re connected to each other fascinates me. I&#39;m currently focusing on
        maintaining/improving my Spanish (B1) and learning Dutch (A1).</li>
      <li>Gardening! I&#39;ve accumulated quite a few houseplants over the years and I&#39;m slowly expanding into
        growing
        plants I can use in the kitchen. I also volunteer at the UT Dallas Community Garden.</li>
    </ul>
