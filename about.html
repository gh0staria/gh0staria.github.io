<p>My name is Liz Wigglesworth &amp; I'm a high school student who loves to learn, write code, and design things.</p>

<p>Among other things, I enjoy reading, baking unnecessary amounts of cookies, and attempting to sing along to the Hamilton soundtrack. In college I plan on studying computer science, film production, or video game development (or some combination of the  three!).</p>
