	<p>My name is Liz Wigglesworth & I'm a first year computer science major who loves to learn, write code, and design.</p>
	<p>I started programming when I was 13 and I've dabbled in many languages since then, but I'm best at Java and JavaScript. I love learning about technology and experimenting with new things!</p>
