My name is Liz Wigglesworth & I'm a high school student who loves to learn, write code, and design.

Among other things, I enjoy reading, operating cameras for my school's sports broadcasting program, and playing video games. In college I plan on studying computer science, film production, or video game development (or some combination of the three!).
