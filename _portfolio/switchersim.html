<p>SwitcherSIM is educational software designed to simulate the live production experience for broadcast students. Switchers and other hardware for live production are expensive, so SwitcherSIM allows students to gain experience in real-world broadcast scenarios through browser-based simulations. Students are then prepared to make a seamless transition to working with real hardware.</p>
<p>I'm the simulation developer at BroadcastSIMS and one of the founders of the company. As a former broadcast student myself, I understand how important it is to learn by doing and how difficult that is in a classroom with 20-30 students but only one piece of equipment. SwitcherSIM is the biggest project I've worked on to date and I'm incredibly proud of what it can do.</p>
