<p>LangBot is a project I worked on in Fall 2019 for ACM Projects, a program run by my campus's chapter of ACM. My teammates and I had ten weeks to turn our ideas for LangBot into a working app.</p>
<p>We chose Spanish as our language to focus on because most of us were at least partly familiar with it. After that, we planned out the basic features we needed to develop, assigned tasks, and got to work. I was on the backend part of the team, so I spent most of my time working with Firebase, DialogFlow, and the Google Cloud Platform. This was also the first time I had used React Native, so I was learning that while we worked to design our messaging system.</p>

The main features of LangBot are:
  <ul>
    <li>text messaging UI</li>
    <li>natural conversation flow with Dialogflow</li>
    <li>signup & login</li>
    <li>cloud storage of user messages</li>
    <li>toggling speech-to-text</li>
    <li>word/phrase translation</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Working on LangBot was a great learning experience. This was one of the first team programming projects I worked on, so learning how to organize as a team and make use of GitHub's collaboration features was vital. This was also an opportunity to work with some new technologies and learn more about nodejs.</p>
<p>LangBot was built by Kishan Brahmbhatt, David Gutierrez, Nayan Paul, Saloni Shivdasani, and Liz Wigglesworth. Our student mentor was Jessie Luo. You can view the project repository <a href="https://github.com/acm-projects/langbot" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
