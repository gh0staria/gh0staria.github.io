<p>WaveTab is a browser extension for Firefox and Google Chrome that shows you a simple, beautiful gradient every time you open a new tab.</p>

<p>I created WaveTab because I had tried to use lots of different new tab extensions and none of them were quite what I was looking for. I wanted something that was simple and loaded fast, so downloading huge pictures wasn't an option. I didn't need to-do lists or other fancy features - just a new tab page. I've been using WaveTab for three years and I've fine-tuned it to the way I work.</p>
