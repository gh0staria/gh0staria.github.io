Hi! I'm Liz Wigglesworth. I'm a Computer Science student in the final year of my B.S at the University of Texas at Dallas.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/lizgw) has the projects I've worked on over the years. They range from small example repos to semester-long projects.

Some of my interests in technology are...

- general cybersecurity
- embedded systems & security
- the indie web
- computer literacy & technical education

But of course, I'm not all about technology. Some other things I do are...

- Bookbinding!
- Gardening! I've accumulated quite a few houseplants over the years and I'm slowly expanding into growing plants I can use in the kitchen.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/lizgw) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-wigglesworth/).
